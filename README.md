<h3> <u>Description: </u></h3>
<p>
    A React Web Application for visuzalizing some algorithms. For some programmers, the biggest problem in learning general algorithms is that they are unable to visualize how these algorithms work under the hood.
</p>
<p>
    This web application lets you visualize 5 different kind of algorithms. You can customize and set your own parameters, and the annimations will adapt according to those parameters.
</p>
<p> For now, the various algorithms available are :  </p>
<ul style="list-style:none">
    <li> Binary Search </li>
    <li> Linear Search </li>
    <li> Breadth First Search </li>
    <li> Depth First Search </li>
    <li> Conway's Game of Life </li>
 </ul>

 <p>More algorithms may be added to the webapp depending upon the response and feedback</p>

<h3> <u>Requirements: </u></h3>
<p> You will need to setup the following enviroment if you want to run this project in your machine: </p>

<ul> 
    <li> <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js </a>
    <li> React Js </li>
    <li> A browser: preferably Google Chrome </li>
</ul>

<h3> <u>Install Guide & Usage: </u> </h3>
<ul style="list-style: none">
    <li> Clone the repo on your local machine </li>
    <li> Open up the terminal in the project dir and run the 
</ul>

```bash
    npm install
    npm start
```

<p>Use sudo as  prefix if you are on linux</p>
<p> Copy paste the address displayed in the terminal to your browser and there you have it.</p>
<p> It is highly recommended that you read through the instructions on landing page to get an idea on how to customize the parameters for your algorithm </p>

<small>Credits: Even though I tried my best to implement the Conway's game of life myself, I could not quite get it right. <br/> Which is where I came across <a href="https://github.com/benawad/react-conway-game-of-life"> Ben Awad's Implementation of Conways Game of Life using React</a>.
My implementation of CGOL is partially based on his approach.</small>
